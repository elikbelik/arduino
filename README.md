An app that controls a chip! Who chould have thought on such a marvel?

## Installtion:

Just follow these simple steps.

### Step 1: Download the File

1.  On your Android phone, download the `MorganaSchedualer.apk` file.

### Step 2: Open the File

1.  Once the download is complete, open your phone's **"Files"** app (it might be called "My Files" or "File Manager").
2.  Go to your **"Downloads"** folder.
3.  Tap on the `MorganaSchedualer.apk` file.

### Step 3: Allow Installation

Your phone will show a security warning. This is completely normal because the app isn't from the Play Store.

1.  A pop-up will appear saying something like: **"For your security, your phone is not allowed to install unknown apps from this source."**
2.  On this pop-up, tap the **"Settings"** button.
3.  You'll be taken to a new screen. Find the app you used to open the file (like "Files" or "Chrome") and **turn ON** the toggle switch next to **"Allow from this source"**.

### Step 4: Install the App

1.  Tap the **"Back"** button once. You will return to the installation screen.
2.  A new pop-up will ask: **"Do you want to install this application?"**
3.  Tap **"Install"**.
4.  Wait a few seconds for it to finish.

That's it! You can now open **MorganaScheduler** from the final screen or find its new icon in your app list.
